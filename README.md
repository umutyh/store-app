Used ASP.NET,autorest,xamarin and syncfusion controls. 
Created an Android app, while it is in cross-platform language with some manipulating it can be compiled for IOS using MacOS.
The app can be used to keep track of stock in a small business.
The project is in Clean Architecture manner, I hope it is readable.
